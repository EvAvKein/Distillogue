Remaining known tasks before first deployment:

### Tasks:
* Basic user & user-to-user functionality (added cautiously, quality & impact > quantity)
* Flagship features:
  * Post-viewing layouts: Simple, mindmap (name TBD), others welcome
  * A ton more config options (many already planned, specifics TBA and/or TBD)
* Security:
  * Data validation (API & preemptive in frontend)
  * Proper registration/authentication (likely only via third parties)
  * DDoS mitigation & maybe a CDN (consider Cloudflare)
  * HTTP headers checkup (API & frontend)
  * Probably others (i.e actively look for more)
* Regulation:
  * Legal obligations (there's likely a comprehensive resource on this)
  * Concise Terms-of-Service/Code-of-Conduct
  * Moderation interface (for both users & management)
* Transparency:
  * If collected, publicly display any 'bulk data' (there's probably a better term for that) e.g monthly active users, configs by popularity
  * A 'why'/core-principles/core-values/project-philosophy page
  * Other ideas welcome!
* Accessibility:
  * Aria attributes
  * Accessibility tree checkup
* Design makeover:
  * General UI style
  * Color palette
  * Transitions
  * Long-term (possibly commissioned/paid) logo & icons
* Simplify contributing:
  * Prettier
  * Dockerized dev setup (see https://github.com/EvAvKein/Distillogue/issues/1)
