# Remaining tasks for each stage of the project

<hr>

## ~~Minimal initial deployment~~ COMPLETE

## Proof-of-concept

- ### Flagship/core features:
  - Identities system (already planned)
  - Mindmap layout using D3.js (name TBD), and potentially another? (ideas welcome)
  - More post config options (many already planned, specifics TBA and/or TBD)
  - User & user-to-user functionalities (latter added very cautiously)
  - Others? (ideas welcome)
- ### Regulation:
  - Platform moderation
  - User-to-user moderation (post owner & any appointed)
- ### Resources & Transparency:
  - Publicly display any and all aggregate data collected e.g weeky/monthly active users, configs by popularity
  - A 'why'/core-principles/core-values/project-philosophy page
- ### Ease of Contributing:
  - Dockerized dev setup (see https://github.com/EvAvKein/Distillogue/issues/1)
- ### Optimization:
  - Migrate tests from Cypress to Playwright
  - Write test for dashboard contacts page
  <hr>

## Release-worthy

- ### All of the above
- ### Basic features:
  - Session-management dashboard page
- ### Security:
  - HTTPS (see https://github.com/EvAvKein/Distillogue/issues/2)
  - Proper registration/authentication (likely only via third parties)
  - DDoS mitigation & maybe a CDN (consider Cloudflare)
- ### Regulation:
  - Comprehensive legal obligations
  - Concise terms-of-service (and potentially code-of-conduct)
- ### Design:
  - General UI makeover
  - Better color palette
  - Long-term logo & icons (possibly commissioned/paid)
- ### Resources & Transparency:
  - Proper front page
  - Proper about page
  - Concise footer
  - Versioned API
  - Contact page (e.g feedback/contact form)
  - Other ideas (especially transparency-related) welcome!
- ### Accessibility:
  - Aria attributes & accessibility tree checkup (need to find free, toggleable, configurable software for testing. devtools accessibility tree is insufficient)
- ### Optimization:
  - Client-side input validation (for preemptive, human-readable errors)
