## Motives

### My motives with this project ARE:

* Developing and refining this brainchild into a highly customizable tool (with general-purpose & custom presets); built to enable, guide, and nurture productive conversations

* Familiarizing myself with my tech stack of choice and being able to display that familiarity (e.g when applying for my first dev job)

### My motives with this project ARE NOT:

* Creating a new social media platform   
...There's more than enough of those already, managing their social aspects and PR is a headache, etc. *If* this project takes off, I'd want it to be an invite-based social tool (e.g Zoom, Trello), or at most be social-media-adjacent (e.g Curious Cat, Linktree, etc). I want it to be topic-centric rather than user-centric

* Advertising an idea to be bought or to attract investors  
I want to make this thing to express my skills/ideals, and it would be neat if it ends up being useful to other people too. Work on this is finite, and I want to see it through without a bottomless profit motive spoiling it like it did many other things
