		<h1>About</h1>

		<h2>Status</h2>

		<p>
			The project is currently not in active development, see
			<a class="core_contentButton" href="https://github.com/EvAvKein/Distillogue#readme">the project's README file</a>
			for further details

		<h2>Concepts</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>A social tool, not a social hub</strong>: For many reasons, I'm not interested in this being anyone's
					primary social app
				</p>
				<p>
					I plan for this to be a social-media-adjacent tool for people who primarily communicate elsewhere: The
					future/existence of public posts beyond the project's early development is very uncertain, and plans for any
					user-to-user interactions (as opposed to post/topic-centric ones) are minimal and under intense scrutiny
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Highly customizable</strong>: The project's main gimmick is the (planned) wide of variety of options
					for post configurations: Allowing users to formulate their preferred social environment with just the features
					they appreciate, with which they 'distill' the social dynamics/interactions/options to their preference
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm open to the idea of allowing user-created plugins for various configurations/layouts (and/or maybe even
					robust support for compatability with forks and/or federating e.g. ActivityPub), but that's far off in the
					future if/when the project matures and/or gains a userbase
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>User-moderated</strong>: To avoid the time-sinks and drama of platform moderation, I want to hand over
					moderation to the users as much as legally/ethically viable
				</p>
				<p>
					I plan on implementing robust configurations for moderation paradigms (e.g. direct/representative-democracy,
					creator-approved moderators) and functionalities, alongside carefully-conceived optional and/or obligatory
					countermeasures (likely just for the less-democratic ones) to mitigate abuse
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
