npm's "class-validator" is a much better fit for this project (considering the existing classes for the vast majority of incoming data) ...but the class-validator (non-bot) maintainers abandoned it without any (easy-to-find) public statement, and projects (nestJS and another i cant recall right now) decided to migrate away from it (and i'm assuming these two situations are related) :\

i'd rather do some extra work (and even have the maintenance burden of distinct classes & validators) if it means using a package that isn't as liable to be vulnerable/buggy (and become more so over time)

links to class-validator's repo and npm, in hopes they ever become maintained again: https://github.com/typestack/class-validator https://www.npmjs.com/package/class-validator
